    "In the previous exercise, you saw how to create a neural network that figured out the problem you were trying to solve. This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function `y=2x-1` directly instead of bothering with using machine learning to learn the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n",

When applied to model outputs, you can think of the scaled values as the probability for that class. For example, in your classification model which has 10 units in the output dense layer, having the highest value at `index = 4` means that the model is most confident that the input clothing image is a coat. If it is at index = 5, then it is a sandal, and so forth. See the short code block below which demonstrates these concepts. You can also watch this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLux1SW--oM&ab_channel=DeepLearningAI) if you want to know more about the Softmax function and how the values are computed.\n"
